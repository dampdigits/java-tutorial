## File-System

This repository contains two main folders:

- [Problems](problems) - This folder contains a **PROBLEMS.md** file which lists all the problems in this tutorial.
- [Solutions](solutions) - This folder contains a sub-folder for each problem in **problems**. Each sub-folder contains:
    - a java program with the solution
    - a .class file that gives desired outputs
    - any other folder or files that might be necessary to test the program

## Usage

- To solve a problem, you are suggested to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo?platform=windows&tool=webui#about-forks) the repository of that problem which will create a copy of that repository in your own GitHub account where you can write your source code.

  **How to fork a problem?**

    1. Go to the [problems](problems) folder and from the [PROBLEMS.md](problems/PROBLEMS.md) file click on the problem you want to solve, say for example Find-Word. This will direct you to the repository of Find-Word.

       ![fork1](https://github.com/its-triple-s/java-tutorial/assets/113439449/79222b40-4857-4be1-b89c-73df9389176a)

     2. Simply click on the **fork** button to create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
        
        ![fork2](https://github.com/its-triple-s/java-tutorial/assets/113439449/3be50fa8-31a4-4e93-9795-dc4ba4499156)

    3. While creating the forked repository you may change the name and the description. Then click on **Create fork**.
   
        ![fork3](https://github.com/its-triple-s/java-tutorial/assets/113439449/9534db83-95e5-43c1-901a-b88eecb6a5cc)

    4. It will take a few seconds to create your forked repository. Once its created, thoroughly read the **README.md** file of your forked repository to understand the problem and how to solve it. You may then click on the java file to view the problem-program.

       ![fork4](https://github.com/its-triple-s/java-tutorial/assets/113439449/34c974d2-ff5d-41ae-a6a8-7d9f2b73a86d)

- To write the source code and solve the problem, you are suggested to use a [GitHub Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview#what-is-a-codespace) for your forked repository.

  **How to create a GitHub codespace?**

  1. From the top nav-bar click on the Create new button with a **+** sign & a drop-down menu and click on **New codespace**.
     
     or

     Click on the profile picture of your GitHub account in the top right corner. From the menu click on **Your codespaces**.
     
     ![codespace1](https://github.com/its-triple-s/java-tutorial/assets/113439449/b009b8bc-bc5e-4a5a-b373-0d08ff021758)

     In your codespaces page click on **New codespace**.

     ![codespace2](https://github.com/its-triple-s/java-tutorial/assets/113439449/fb7613d0-ce7c-42c7-b225-774e1de3e485)


  3. In your create codespace page, select the repository of the problem and click on **Create codespace**.
 
     ![codespace3](https://github.com/its-triple-s/java-tutorial/assets/113439449/d28f6758-3ebc-4f19-8b09-7d89f7bb45c1)

  4. Once your codespace is created, click on the .java file from the explorer tab on your left to open the source code and you are ready to code.
 
     ![codespace4](https://github.com/its-triple-s/java-tutorial/assets/113439449/c5940004-dae1-4459-9be4-4d75ef71b630)

  **Note:** Don't forget to [stop your codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/stopping-and-starting-a-codespace) when you are done.
