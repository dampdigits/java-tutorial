# Find-Word

This java program finds the total number of times a word has appeared in a text file.
This program takes a command line argument such as `texts/short.txt` indicating the text file it must read. It then takes a word as user input. The program then reads the entire text file to find the total number of occurrences of that word.

## Usage


You will be prompted to enter a word to search for. The program will then output the total number of occurrences of that word in the text file.

## Example

```
$ java Main texts/short.txt
Enter a word to search for: **the**
The word 'the' appears 5 times in texts/short.txt.
```
